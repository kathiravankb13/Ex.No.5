# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: 

# Explanation: 
Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.



## Define Prompt Types

Naïve Prompt – Broad, unstructured, vague, or incomplete prompt without much detail.
Example: “Write a story.”

Basic Prompt – Clear, structured, and detailed prompt with context and instructions.
Example: “Write a short 200-word story about a brave girl who finds a magic stone in a forest. Include suspense and a happy ending.”

## Test Scenarios

We choose 4 scenarios to evaluate:

Creative Story Generation

Factual Question Answering

Summarization Task

Advice/Recommendation

# OUTPUT
| **Scenario**         | **Naïve Prompt**         | **Naïve Response (Summary)**                                | **Basic Prompt**                                                                                                                                 | **Basic Response (Summary)**                                      | **Analysis**                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Story**         | “Write a story.”         | A random short story, unclear plot, lacks focus.            | “Write a 200-word story about a girl who finds a magic stone in the forest with suspense and a happy ending.”                                    | Focused plot, suspenseful middle, proper ending, clear structure. | Basic prompt gives better clarity, coherence, and depth. |
| **2. Factual Qn**    | “Tell me about the sun.” | General, surface-level info.                                | “Explain the structure of the Sun with its layers (core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, corona) in simple English.” | Detailed explanation, layer-by-layer, easy to understand.         | Basic prompt improves accuracy and organization.         |
| **3. Summarization** | “Summarize AI.”          | Very broad, high-level summary.                             | “Summarize Artificial Intelligence in 5 simple bullet points covering definition, types, applications, benefits, and challenges.”                | Well-structured bullet points covering requested areas.           | Basic prompt ensures completeness and balance.           |
| **4. Advice**        | “Give me advice.”        | Generic, random life advice (e.g., be positive, work hard). | “Give 3 study tips for a student preparing for competitive exams with time management focus.”                                                    | Clear, targeted, and practical advice relevant to scenario.       | Basic prompt narrows scope and improves usefulness.      |



## Analysis

Quality: Basic prompts consistently produced more coherent and well-structured answers.

Accuracy: Basic prompts reduced irrelevant or vague responses by directing the model toward specific content.

Depth: Responses to basic prompts had more details, organization, and explanation compared to naïve prompts.

Observation: Naïve prompts sometimes gave acceptable answers for very simple/general queries, but struggled with complex tasks.

## Summary of Findings

Prompt clarity and structure directly impact the usefulness of ChatGPT’s responses.

Basic prompts consistently outperform naïve prompts in terms of quality, accuracy, and depth.

For best results, prompts should be:

Specific (clearly define task)

Detailed (mention format/length/points to cover)

Contextual (provide background or purpose)
# RESULT: 
The prompt for the above said problem executed successfully
